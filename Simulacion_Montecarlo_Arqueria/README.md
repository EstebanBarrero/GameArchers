### General Info
***
This project gives a solution to the Monte Carlo problem where the idea at this point is to perform, using the MonteCarlo method, the simulation of an Archery game between two mixed teams of 5 participants each, generated in a pseudo-random way
pseudo-randomly, taking into account different characteristics for each of the players.
